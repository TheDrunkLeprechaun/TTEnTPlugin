[---------------------Tactical Testificate Entrenchment Bukkit Plugin---------------------]
Author: Colin Moore
Description: This plugin creates a whole new playing style. Operators can create matches in
which players defend their village full of innocent testificates from endless waves of mobs.
They are given some basic tools, some armor, and some food to use at their disgression.
On their death, they drop a skull, which annother player playing with them can then grab and
place at the spawnpoint, in the village's church, to resurrect the player. When dead, players
are teleported into the nether where they stay until they are ressurected or the game ends.
